 first to make an empty folder in your system. 
 Now open this empty folder in vs code. 
 now do npm init. 
 this will create an empty npm project. 
 which contain only package.json file. 

to track all the changes we  add git to this folder. 

we do  git init. 

PS C:\Users\mohan\OneDrive\Desktop\BackEndProject> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/mohan/OneDrive/Desktop/BackEndProject/.git/

now all this is untacable. for that we need to stage all of them. 
git add .
