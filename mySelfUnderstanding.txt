first to make an empty folder in your system. 
Now open this empty folder in vs code. 
now do npm init. 
this will create an empty npm project. 
which contain only package.json file. 

to track all the changes we  add git to this folder. 

we do  git init. 

PS C:\Users\mohan\OneDrive\Desktop\BackEndProject> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/mohan/OneDrive/Desktop/BackEndProject/.git/

now all this is untacable. for that we need to stage all of them. 
git add .

for commit 
git commit -m "add inicial files for backend"
this can also be done throught the vs code GUI. 

write now the branch at which we are working is master branch. 

to rename this branch to main we can type 
to match github standards. 
git branch -M main
renaming the -M used to rename existing current branch to some new name 
we can see the branch name in left corner 
---------------------------------------------
first creating a new repository in github
name is BackendProject 
ssh https://github.com/Umeshchaurasiya123/BackendProject.git
--------------------------------------

Now to push the code set the origin throught the ssh . 

git remote add origin https://github.com/Umeshchaurasiya123/BackendProject.git

Now remote is set. so all the code will push to repository named BackendProject 

Now to push as well as set the upstream we use command. 

git push -u origin main

to check the status we have git status. 

give information about changes, trackable , untackedable file etc. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Senario: one important work we do it storing the images of user. 
for storing the images we use 3rd party services. like aws , cloudnary , azur, clould, etc. 
first photo upload and stores temparaily in our server as incase of user connection is lost. than using third party service 
uplaod to clould. 

some company directly uplaod to cloudnary. depend on senarios. 

so let create an folder name public annd inside that creat another folder named temp . 

the problem is when we do git status here. it can not able to track the folder. 
git only track the file. 
so for that we have an file name .getKeep 
this is nothibg but empty file
used to keep the track the of the  empty folder which might be need for project structue. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now in repository we need some new file like .gitignore 
tell the git to ignore which file, folder , apikeys, etc. 
basically ignoring the sensitive files or files. 
or files or folder which  which can download any time. 
like node_modules. 

in market we have some  gitignore generator. 
create useful .gitignore files for your project 
https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/#Node

-------------------------------------------------------------------
environment variable files. 

.env
.env.test
.env.production

environment variable like port etc are taken from systme for secqurity not from files. 

but in case if youe haev to still waht to push that to github in that case you can  delete its name from .gitignore file. 
like .env.sample 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now in package.json we specify that our main file is index.js 
so create this also. 

but but but.

it depend on program to stores the whole dirctory file here aur inside the src folder. 
creating an src is good practice. 


now in src create a 3 file name constants.js, index.js, app.js


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
insdie the package.js
now index.js file is inside the src folder. 

And here in this project we are using import syntax so have to specify the type as module rather than common which is used 
in required 

now in past we saw that when we chanegs anything in  progrma , add , remove  to refrect the application 
have to star and stop the application

to avoid that we can use an utility nodemon

nodemon is nothing but jai sai hi file chanegs in dirctory are detected automatically restart the  application 

so nodemon is a tool that help the develop node.js based application by automatically restarting the node application when file changes 
in directory(folder or repository) are detected

-------------------- dependency vs dev dependency------------------------------------
dev dependency is  dependency which is used during the devlopment. ise prodiction mai nahi leke jate. 

yai sirf devlopment mai kaam aaiga. production mai ise kaam mai nahi lete. 

npm i nodemon this will make it as  main dependency 

for devlopment  dependency we haev 

you can install nodemon as devlopment dependency

npm install --save-dev nodemon 

or npm install -D nodemon

now in package.json file i get 
"devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.7"
  }

now nodemon will reload whatever you write inside the src folder if change detected. 

but that also need to be specify in package.json file. 

now i will create one command in script name dev 

"scripts": {
    "dev": "node src/index.js"
  },

now when i do npm run dev
it will execute the command.  node src/index.js 
basically run the index.js which is our main program. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

issue bitween .enn and import. 

to use the .env we have to use  require('dotenv').config()

but in type we mention  module 

means we have to sue require syntax not import . 

there is solution for that also.
